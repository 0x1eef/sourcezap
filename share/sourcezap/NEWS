* v1.3.4

**** Grant group members write access to the source tree
Grant members of the ~_sourcezap~ group write access to
both ~/usr/src~, and ~/home/_sourcezap/src~. This will
allow unprivileged users to more easily build the source
tree

**** Remove verbose output from Makefile's install target
Remove verbose output from the Makefile's install target
by dropping the ~-v~ flag from the ~install~ comman

* v1.3.2

**** Update source code documentation
Update source code documentation / comments

* v1.3.1

**** Remove ~$LOCALBASE~ reference from ~bin/sourcezap~
The ~$LOCALBASE~ reference in ~bin/sourcezap~ has been
replaced with a relative path (similar to earlier changes)

**** Reimplement option parser with getopts
This change reimplements the option parser with getopts.
The previous implementation was complex and custom

* v1.3.0

**** Improve sourcezap.8
There were a few omissions in the man page that have
been updated and corrected

**** Replace ${LOCALBASE} with relative paths
This change replaces the use of ${LOCALBASE} with paths that
are relative to ~$(dirname "${0}")/..~ instead. In the process
two variables (~${localbase}, ${libexec}~) have became one
variable (~${libexec}~)

**** Default to GitHub.com
By default ~sourcezap clone~ now clones from GitHub.com. This
is both faster, and a little more reliable than cloning from
https://git.hardenedbsd.org

The previous default can be restored by setting the environment
variable ~${SOURCEZAP_CLONEURL}~ before running ~sourcezap clone~

**** Revisit log messages
More consistent with other log messages.
See
***** ~fgrep -rn printok libexec/ bin/~
***** ~fgrep -rn printerr libexec/ bin/~

**** Add ~sourcezap sh~ to man page
The ~sourcezap sh~ command was missing from the SYNOPIS section

** Remove ~sourcezap checkout~
Remove the ~sourcezap checkout~ command. It has been replaced
by using ~sourcezap sh~ alongside ~git checkout <branch>~

* v1.2.1

**** Install ~doas.conf~
When ~${PREFIX}/etc/doas.conf~ does not exist the ~setup-doas~
script will try to install ~/usr/local/etc/doas.conf~ with
~root:wheel~ as the owner, and with ~u=rw,go=~ as the filemode

**** Log when ~sourcezap rm~ completes successfully
Similar to other commands, log when the ~sourcezap rm~ command
completes successfully

**** Format log messages with program name
Format log messages written to standard output and standard error
with the pattern ~sourcezap: <message>~

**** Replace chmod with -M switch

~pw useradd~ command in the ~setup-user~ script

This new directory replaces what was formerly known
as ~libexec/sourcezap/setup~

as ~libexec/sourcezap/utils~

* v1.1.0

**** Add 'libexec/sourcezap/utils/get-umask'
Add a single source of truth for the mask given to umask
by git and sourcezap-install

**** Break up ~sourcezap-install~ into multiple files
A new directory (~libexec/sourcezap/utils/install/~) contains
files that cover both a fresh install and applying an update

**** Add ~setup/setup-doas~ improvements
More likely to do what's expected, but blind spots still exist

**** Add ~sourcezap setup~, ~sourcezap teardown~
